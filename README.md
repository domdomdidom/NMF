## Intro & Motivation
NMF is a powerful linear-algebra tool often used in recommender systems, as it performs well in sparse circumstances. NMF can extract latent "topics" from a matrix - think movie genres, article subjects, etc. It works by decomposing an m x n matrix into a m x p matrix, W, and a p x n matrix, H, with p being the number of latent topics.
